                    <p>
                        Iâ€™ve hosted several commercial podcasts covering a variety of subjects, including technology and health.
                         These podcasts explored topics like tech innovations, digital health tools, and the future of healthcare. 
                         I interviewed experts and industry leaders, creating content that made complex topics accessible and interesting for a wide audience. 
                         My work involved researching, planning, and hosting each episode.<br/>

                        Throughout this role, I honed my skills in interviewing and storytelling. I focused on distilling complex information into clear narratives and guiding conversations in a way that engages the listener.<br/><br/>
